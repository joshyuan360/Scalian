Childhood .

The parent Johann Sebastian Johann Ambrosius Bach ( 11 ) Maria Elisabeth Lämmerhirt ( 1644–94 ) , daughter furrier town councillor Erfurt , Valentin Lämmerhirt ( 1665 ) .

Another Lämmerhirt daughter became mother Bach’s cousin J.G .

Walther , suggesting Lämmerhirt blood perhaps unimportant musical talent Bach family’s greatest son .

Elisabeth’s elder half-sister Hedwig Lämmerhirt second wife Ambrosius Bach’s uncle , Johann Bach ( 4 ) , organist Predigerkirche Erfurt .

Elisabeth Ambrosius , worked Eisenach since 1671 Hausmann also musician ducal court Saxe-Eisenach , married 8 April 1668 , eight child , five survived infancy ; well Johann Sebastian , last , three son ( nos.22 , 71 23 ) daughter , Maria Salome .

The date Johann Sebastian’s birth , 21 March 1685 , carefully recorded Walther Lexicon , Sebastian family genealogy , son co-author obituary .

It supported date baptism ( 23 March ; date old-style ) register St Georg .

His godfather Johann Georg Koch , forestry official , Sebastian Nagel , Gotha Stadtpfeifer .

The house birth longer stand ; handsome old structure ( Frauenplan 21 ) acquired Neue Bachgesellschaft 1907 ‘Bachhaus’ established Bach Museum .

He would born house Fleischgasse ( Lutherstrasse ) Ambrosius Bach bought 1674 gaining Eisenach citizenship .

After time Reformation child Eisenach obliged go school age five 12 , ( although documentary evidence ) Sebastian must entered one town’s German school 1690 .

From 1692 attended Lateinschule ( Luther , also Eisenach boy ) ; offered sound humanistic theological education .

At Easter 1693 47th fifth class , absent 96 half-days ; 1694 lost 59 half-days , rose 14th promoted ; Easter 1695 23rd fourth class , spite lost 103 half-days ( perhaps owing illness , probably also death parent ) .

He stood one two place brother Jacob , three year older le frequently absent .

Nothing known Eisenach career ; said unusually good treble probably sang Kantor A.C. Dedekind St Georg , father made instrumental music sermon relation ( 2 ) Johann Christoph Bach ( 13 ) organist .

His musical education matter conjecture ; presumably father taught rudiment string playing , ( according Emanuel ) formal tuition keyboard instrument went Ohrdruf .

He later described Johann Christoph ‘a profound composer’ ; doubt impressed latter’s organ playing well composition .

Elisabeth Bach buried 3 May 1694 , 27 November Ambrosius married Barbara Margaretha , née Keul , daughter former mayor Arnstadt .

Aged 35 , already twice widowed .

Her first husband musician , Johann Günther Bach ( 15 ) , second theologian , Jacobus Bartholomaei ( marriage taken place Arnstadt ) , brought third marriage two little daughter , Catharina Margareta Christina Maria , one earlier husband .

A month Ambrosiuss second marriage , 23 October 1694 , family celebrated wedding eldest son , Johann Christoph ( 22 ) Ohrdruf .

The music occasion Ambrosius Bach , Johann Pachelbel nearby Gotha friend family member .

This probably occasion nine-year-old Sebastian met Pachelbel , brother’s teacher .

Barely three month re-marrying , 20 February 1695 , Ambrosius Bach died long serious illness .

On 4 March widow appealed town council help ; received legal due , household broke .

Sebastian Jacob taken elder brother Johann Christoph , organist Ohrdruf .

Both sent Lyceum .

Jacob left age 14 apprenticed father’s successor Eisenach ; Sebastian stayed 1700 , nearly 15 , thus came influence exceptionally enlightened curriculum .

Inspired educationist Comenius , embraced religion , reading , writing , arithmetic , singing , history natural science .

Sebastian entered fourth class probably March 1695 , promoted third July : 20 July 1696 first among seven new boy fourth class ; 19 July 1697 first , promoted second class ; 13 July 1698 fifth ; 24 July 1699 second , promoted first class , fourth left school 15 March 1700 went Lüneburg .

In obituary Emanuel stated father first keyboard lesson Christoph , Ohrdruf ; 1775 , replying Forkel , said Christoph might trained simply organist , Sebastian became ‘a pure strong fuguist’ effort .

That likely enough ; Christoph known composer .

Several early biographer told story Christoph would allow brother use certain manuscript ; Sebastian copied moonlight ; Christoph took copy away ; recover Christoph died .

Emanuel Forkel assumed Christoph died 1700 , Sebastian , left homeless , went Lüneburg desperation .

Later author , knowing Christoph lived 1721 , brother good term , tended reject story – perhaps unnecessarily , may illustrate contemporary attitude discipline restraint .

In fact , story fit well little known Ohrdruf year , idea Sebastian taught composition copying .

Most probably recovered copy went Lüneburg .

As content , Forkel implied contained work seven famous composer , three northerner .

He probably misunderstood Emanuel’s reply another question ; according obituary , manuscript mainly southern ( Froberger , Kerll , Pachelbel ) – one would expect , since Johann Christoph Pachelbel pupil .

( A good idea content obtained manuscript collection compiled 1692 another Pachelbel’s pupil , J.V .

Eckelt . )

The larger two organ Ohrdruf almost unplayable condition 1697 , Sebastian doubt picked expert knowledge organ building helping brother repair .

No documentary evidence exists establish Bach started compose , reasonable suppose lived Ohrdruf – least contemporary , son due course , began composing original music reaching age 15 .

The earliest organ chorale Neumeister manuscript , well work bwv749 , 750 756 , provide plausible example piece composed around 1700 .

They characterized sound craftsmanship , observance model provided Pachelbel ( teacher’s teacher ) everywhere sense endeavour break away musical convention find independent answer .

Lüneburg .

According school register , Sebastian left Ohrdruf ‘ob defectum hospitiorum’ ( ‘for lack board lodging’ ) ; clearly Christoph longer room brother .

Since latter’s arrival two child ; March 1700 third expected ; ( local tradition trusted ) house , destroyed , mere cottage .

The brothers’ problem seems solved Elias Herda , Kantor master Lyceum .

He educated Lüneburg , doubt arranged Sebastian go north ; probably similarly helped Georg Erdmann , fellow pupil Sebastian’s , three year older , left school Bach ( reason ) .

According obituary travelled together .

They must reached Lüneburg end March entered register Mettenchor ( Matins choir ) 3 April 1700 probably sang within matter day Holy Week Easter .

The Michaeliskirche , Lüneburg , two school associated : Ritteracademie young nobleman , Michaelisschule commoner .

There also two choir : ‘chorus symphoniacus’ 25 voice led Mettenchor , numbered 15 , limited poor boy .

Members Mettenchor received free schooling Michaelisschule , 1 thaler per month according seniority , keep , share fee wedding occasion ( Bach’s share 1700 put 14 mark ) .

From arrangement pay-sheets deduced treble .

Bach welcomed unusually fine voice ; soon broke , eight day spoke sang octave .

After may may sung , doubt made useful accompanist string player .

As last extant pay-sheet 29 May 1700 , detail known ; clear school short instrumentalist time .

At school , Bach’s study embraced orthodox Lutheranism , logic , rhetoric , Latin Greek , arithmetic , history , geography German poetry .

The Kantor August Braun , whose composition disappeared ; organist , F.C .

Morhard , nonentity .

The organ repaired 1701 J.B. Held , worked Hamburg Lübeck ; lodged school , may taught Bach something organ building .

There fine music library , carefully kept date ; whether choirboy allowed consult uncertain .

If Braun made good use , Bach must learnt good deal music perform ; chief interest probably lay outside school .

At Nikolaikirche J.J. Löwe ( 1629–1703 ) , distinguished elderly .

The Johanniskirche another matter , organist Georg Böhm ( 1661–1733 ) , generally agreed influenced Bach .

It argued organist Johanniskirche would accessible scholar Michaelisschule , since two choir good term , Bach’s knowledge Böhm’s music must come later , J.G .

Walther .

But Emanuel Bach stated writing father studied Böhm’s music ; correction note Forkel show first thought say Böhm father’s teacher .

This hint supported fact 1727 Bach named Böhm northern agent sale Partitas nos.2 3 .

That seems imply two friendly term ; likelier became 1700 1702 later date .

Bach went Hamburg , 50 km away ; probably visited cousin Johann Ernst ( 25 ) , evidently studying time .

The suggestion went hear Vincent Lübeck taken seriously , Lübeck go Hamburg August 1702 , time Bach almost certainly left area .

He may visited Hamburg Opera , directed Reinhard Keiser , whose St Mark Passion performed early Weimar year 1726 ; solid evidence interested anything organ particular organist St Katharinen , J.A .

Reincken , whose influence young Bach theorist practitioner would difficult overestimate .

Marpurg’s familiar anecdote make point neatly : Bach , returning almost penniless Lüneburg , rested outside inn ; someone threw two herring head rubbish heap ; Bach – Thuringian , fish delicacy – picked see portion edible ; found contained two Danish ducat , thus able meal , also ‘to undertake another comfortable pilgrimage Herr Reincken’ .

J.A .

Reincken ( ? 1623–1722 ) , pupil Sweelinck organist St Katharinen since 1663 , father figure north German school .

Böhm may advised Bach hear ; showy playing , exploiting resource organ , must revelation one brought reticent tradition south .

As organ , Bach never forgot ; later year described excellent every way , said 32 Principal best ever heard , never tired praising 16 reed .

Whether actually met Reincken 1720 uncertain .

If , Reincken might given copy sonata ; Bach’s reworkings ( keyboard piece bwv954 , 965 966 ) likely made soon 1700 20 year later , Bach longer needed teach composition .

The market-place Lüneburg graced since end 17th century palace used visit Duke Celle-Lüneburg court ; principal ducal residence seat government lay Celle , 80 km south .

The duke , married Eléonore d’Olbreuse , Huguenot noble birth , pronounced francophile maintained orchestra consisting largely Frenchmen , played Celle Lüneburg .

Thomas de la Selle , dancing-master Ritteracademie next door Bach’s school Lüneburg , also member Celle orchestra .

Emanuel Bach knew father often able hear ‘famous orchestra’ thus become acquainted French taste .

It ruled Bach occasionally helped instrumentalist court orchestra played ducal residence Lüneburg .

The date Bach’s departure Lüneburg known , may suppose completed final school year two year left school Easter 1702 .

It seems unlikely remained Lüneburg length time , left without hearing Buxtehude took extraordinary pain winter 1705–6 .

He probably visited relative Thuringia Easter 1702 .

All definitely known competed successfully vacant post organist St Jacobi Sangerhausen ( organist buried 9 July ) , Duke Weissenfels intervened J.A .

Kobelius , somewhat older man , appointed November .

Bach next heard Weimar , employed court musician first two quarter 1703 ; court account lackey , described ‘Hofmusikant’ ( court musician ) Ursprung .

This minor Weimar court , Duke Johann Ernst , younger brother Duke Wilhelm Ernst Bach served 1708 1717 .

Possibly Duke Weissenfels , refused accept Bach Sangerhausen , found work Weimar ; another possibility Bach owed appointment distant relation , David Hoffmann , another lackey-musician .

Of musician Bach became associated , three worth mentioning .

G.C .

Strattner ( c1644–1704 ) , tenor , became vice-Kapellmeister 1695 , composed post-Schütz style .

J.P. von Westhoff ( 1656–1705 ) fine violinist travelled widely , apparently diplomat , said first compose suite unaccompanied violin ( 1683 ) .

Johann Effler ( c1640–1711 ) court organist : held post Gehren Erfurt ( Pachelbel successor ) coming 1678 Weimar , 1690 moved court .

He may willing hand duty Bach , probably something kind , document 13 July 1703 Arnstadt , Bach next moved , describes Bach court organist Weimar – post officially 1708 .

[ Top pageTop page ] 3 .

Arnstadt .

The Bonifaciuskirche Arnstadt burnt 1581 , subsequently rebuilt 1676–83 ; became known Neue Kirche , remained 1935 , renamed Bach .

In 1699 J.F .

Wender contracted build organ , end 1701 become usable ; 1 January 1702 Andreas Börner formally appointed organist .

The organ complete June 1703 , examined 3 July ; examiner one , Bach named paid , ‘played organ first time’ .

The result 9 August Bach offered post Börner’s head ; time , ‘to prevent collision feared’ , Börner given work .

Bach accepted post ‘by handshake’ 14 August 1703 .

The exact date removal Arnstadt known , address .

As last board lodging allowance paid Feldhaus , probably spent least year either Golden Crown Steinhaus , belonged Feldhaus .

Considering age , local standard , well paid ; duty , specified contract , light .

Normally , required church two hour Sunday morning , service Monday , two hour Thursday morning ; accompany hymn .

He thus plenty time composition organ playing , took model Bruhns , Reincken , Buxtehude ( northerner ) certain good French organist .

There evidence whether took part theatrical musical entertainment court town .

Bach position put elaborate music Arnstadt .

The Neue Kirche , like church , drew performer two group schoolboy senior student .

Only one group capable singing cantata ; supposed go Neue Kirche monthly summer , appear duty roster .

The performer naturally tended go church established tradition friendly organist ; Bach authority prevent , schoolmaster younger many student .

Further , never much patience semi-competent , apt alienate making offensive remark .

One result scuffle J.H .

Geyersbach ( b 1682 ) .

On 4 August 1705 cousin Barbara , elder sister ( aged 26 ) future wife , fell six student christening feast ; one Geyersbach , asked Bach insulted ( bassoon ) , struck face stick .

Bach drew sword , another student separated .

Bach complained consistory would unsafe go street Geyersbach punished , inquiry held .

The consistory told Bach ought insulted Geyersbach try live peaceably student ; , ( claimed ) responsible chorale expected help kind music .

Bach replied musical director appointed , would willing enough .

Bach , unimpressed , asked four weeks’ leave , set Lübeck – ‘what , foot’ , say obituary , adding overwhelming desire hear Buxtehude .

Dates distance cast doubt straightforwardness .

He left Arnstadt 18 October , therefore due back , well way back , 15 November ; would thus unable hear even first Buxtehude’s special service , given various date 15 November 20 December .

Perhaps , like Mattheson Handel , went primarily see chance succeeding Buxtehude , put prospect marrying Buxtehude’s daughter , aged 30 ; case , 1705 rival field .

However may , stayed almost three month Lübeck , absent altogether 16 week , returning Arnstadt shortly 7 February 1706 , communicated .

On 21 February consistory asked Bach away long ; reply unsatisfactory barely civil .

They next complained accompaniment chorale elaborate congregational singing , still refused collaborate student producing cantata ; , could provide Kapellmeister , continued refuse would find someone amenable .

Bach repeated demand musical director , ordered apologize within eight day .

From next case consistory heard day seems actual ‘disordres’ church Bach student .

There evidence Bach apologized , consistory dropped matter eight month .

They brought 11 November , Bach undertook answer writing .

They also accused inviting ‘stranger maiden’ make music church , obtained parson’s permission .

The girl question cousin future wife , long resident Arnstadt therefore would unlikely described stranger .

Neither Bach consistory took action ; doubt saw problem would soon solve .

Probably Bach come back Lübeck exalted idea church music , requiring facility Arnstadt could provide .

His ability becoming known ; 28 November helped examine organ Langewiesen .

Forkel said various post offered ; death J.G .

Ahle , 2 December , sufficiently attractive vacancy seemed arisen .

[ Top pageTop page ] 4 .

Mühlhausen .

Ahle city councillor Mühlhausen , organist St Blasius composer minor rank .

Musical standard fallen tenure office , post respectable one various candidate gave trial performance .

One J.G .

Walther , future lexicographer ; sent two composition 27 February 1707 ( Sexagesima ) , withdrew told privately hope .

Bach played Easter ( 24 April ) may performed Cantata No .

4 .

At city council meeting 24 May name considered , 14 June Bach interviewed .

He asked salary receiving Arnstadt ( 20 gulden Ahle’s ) ; councillor agreed , agreement signed 15 June .

At Arnstadt success became known ; cousin Johann Ernst ( 25 ) predecessor Börner applied Neue Kirche 22 23 June .

He resigned formally 29 June , presumably moved Mühlhausen within day .

It perhaps July wrote Cantata No .

131 ; clearly intended penitential service , perhaps connected disastrous fire 30 May .

It Bach’s Pastor Frohne commissioned cantata , Pastor Eilmar Marienkirche – fact whose possible significance seen later .

Bach’s responsibility Mühlhausen included also convent Augustinian nun organ Wender without pedal ; principal duty play special service .

On 10 August 1707 Tobias Lämmerhirt , Bach’s maternal uncle , died Erfurt .

He left Bach 50 gulden , half salary , thus facilitated marriage Maria Barbara ( b 20 Oct 1684 ) , daughter ( 3 ) Johann Michael Bach ( 14 ) Catharina Wedemann .

The wedding took place 17 October Dornheim , village near Arnstadt ; pastor , J.L .

Stauber ( 1660–1723 ) , friend family married Regina Wedemann 5 June 1708 .

Pupils began come Bach time , perhaps even earlier .

J.M .

Schubart ( 1690–1721 ) said 1707 1717 , J.C. Vogler ( 1696–1763 ) arrived age ten ( Arnstadt ) , left time , returned 1710 1715 .

These two immediate successor Weimar ; time onwards never without pupil .

On 4 February 1708 annual change council took place , Cantata No .

71 performed .

It must made impression , council printed libretto , usual , also music .

Bach next drew plan repairing enlarging St Blasius organ ; council considered 21 February , decided act .

Cantata No .

196 may written Stauber’s wedding 5 June .

At time Bach played reigning Duke Weimar , Wilhelm Ernst , offered post court .

On 25 June Bach wrote council asking accept resignation .

No doubt larger salary Weimar attraction , particularly Bach’s wife pregnant .

But clear , even tactful letter councillor treated well , reason leaving .

He said encouraged ‘well-regulated church music’ church , also surrounding village , harmony often ‘better cultivated here’ ( Spitta found fragment , bwv223 , nearby Langula ) .

He also gone expense collect ‘the choicest sacred music’ .

But member congregation opposed , likely stOp .

Some people doubt disliked type music trying introduce .

Further , Pastor Frohne may distrusted organist ; active Pietist , dagger drawn orthodox Pastor Eilmar Marienkirche – Bach begun Mühlhausen career working Eilmar , become intimate enough Eilmar daughter godparent Bach’s first two child .

The council considered letter 26 June reluctantly let go , asking supervise organ building St Blasius .

However badly Bach may got congregation , evidently good term council .

They paid come perform cantata council service 1709 , possibly also 1710 ( trace work lost ) .

In 1735 negotiated friendly term new council behalf son Johann Gottfried Bernhard ( 47 ) .

He known paid supervising opening St Blasius organ , may done .

[ Top pageTop page ] 5 .

Weimar .

When announced resignation Mühlhausen , Bach said appointed Duke Weimar’s ‘Capelle und Kammermusik’ , long thought become organist .

In fact , Weimar document show 14 July 1708 , ‘reception money’ paid , called ‘the newly appointed court organist’ , almost always called March 1714 , became Konzertmeister well .

Effler , seems , pensioned full salary ( 130 florin ) ; 24 December 1709 received small gift ‘an old sick servant’ , died Jena 4 April 1711 .

It said Bach wrote organ work Weimar , duke took pleasure playing .

His salary outset larger Effler’s ( 150 florin , plus allowance ) ; increased 200 Michaelmas 1711 , 215 June 1713 , 250 promotion 1714 .

On 20 March 1715 ordered share casual fee Kapellmeister’s .

Moreover , seems fair amount spare time , , instance , cultivate acquaintance Telemann latter Eisenach ( 1708–12 ) .

Together violinist Pisendel copied concerto G Telemann’s ( D-Dl ) , probably Pisendel’s visit Weimar 1709 .

Six Bach’s child born Weimar : Catharina ( bap .

29 Dec 1708 ; 14 Jan 1774 ) ; ( 8 ) Wilhelm Friedemann ( 45 ) ( b 22 Nov 1710 ) ; twin ( b 23 Feb 1713 ; died day ) ; ( 9 ) Carl Philipp Emanuel ( 46 ) ( b 8 March 1714 ) ; Johann Gottfried Bernhard ( 47 ) ( b 11 May 1715 ) .

The various godparent show Bach wife kept touch relation friend Ohrdruf , Arnstadt Mühlhausen , besides making fresh contact Weimar ; noteworthy Telemann godfather Emanuel .

On 13 March 1709 Bach , wife , one sister ( probably eldest , Friedelena , died Leipzig 1729 ) living Adam Immanuel Weldig , falsettist Master Pages .

They probably stayed August 1713 , Weldig gave house , secured similar post Weissenfels .

Weldig godfather Emanuel ; Bach ( proxy ) son Weldig’s 1714 .

Weldig’s house destroyed 1944 ; Bach lived given date known .

Since 29 July 1707 , J.G .

Walther ( lexicographer ) organist Stadtkirche ; related Bach mother , Lämmerhirt , two became friendly .

On 27 September 1712 Bach stood godfather Walther’s son .

Forkel told story Walther played trick Bach , cure boasting nothing could read sight .

Their relation deteriorate , Spitta supposed ; 1735 Bach negotiated Walther’s behalf Leipzig publisher J.G .

Krügner , Walther’s reference Bach letter Bokemeyer carry suggestion coolness .

From one letter seems nine year Weimar Bach gave Walther 200 piece music , Buxtehude , others composition .

Of Bach’s pupil , Schubart Vogler already mentioned .

The pupil Bach paid Ernst August’s account 1711–12 Duke Ernst August page called Jagemann .

J.G .

Ziegler ( 1688–1747 ) matriculated University Halle 12 October 1712 , studied Bach year , taught play chorale ‘not superficially , according sense words’ ; Bach’s wife stood godmother daughter 1718 , 1727 Bach employed agent , Halle , Partitas nos.2 3 .

P.D .

Krauter Augsburg ( 1690–1741 ) set Weimar March 1712 , stayed September 1713 .

Johann Lorenz Bach ( 38 ) probably arrived autumn 1713 ; may left Weimar July 1717 .

Johann Tobias Krebs ( 1690–1762 ) studied Walther 1710 , Bach 1714 1717 .

Johann Bernhard Bach ( 41 ) worked uncle 1715 March 1719 , alongside Samuel Gmelin ( 1695–1752 ) , appears left 1717 .

C.H .

Dretzel Nuremberg ( 1697–1775 ) may briefly Bach .

In 1731 , applying post , T.C .

Gerlach ( 1694–1768 ) implied Bach teaching correspondence 14 year , confused phraseology taken literally .

The specification organ castle chapel , published 1737 , always reprinted correctly ; case , represent organ Bach left 1717 .

Extensive alteration made 1719–30 .

Still le specification represent organ Bach faced 1708 , made even extensive alteration 1713–14 .

The organ said built Compenius 1657–8 .

It overhauled 1707–8 , Sub-Bass added , J.C. Weishaupt , carried maintenance work 1712 .

A contract alteration however signed 29 June 1712 H.N .

Trebs ( 1678–1748 ) , moved Mühlhausen Weimar 1709 .

Bach worked together new organ Taubach 1709–10 , opened Bach 26 October 1710 ; 1711 gave Trebs handsome testimonial , 1713 Walther became godfather Trebs’s son .

Bach Trebs collaborated 1742 , organ Bad Berka .

Trebs’s new organ usable 1714 ; done 14 days’ tuning 19 May , paid 15 September .

Of rebuild nothing known , except either Bach duke determined instrument include Glockenspiel ; great trouble taken obtaining bell dealer Nuremberg Leipzig , seems original set 29 ( number hard account ) replaced difficulty blend pitch .

In 1737 organ Glockenspiel Oberwerk , alteration made 1719–20 follow Glockenspiel 1714 manual .

In December 1709 February 1710 Bach paid repairing harpsichord household junior duke , Ernst August Prince Johann Ernst .

On 17 January 1711 godfather daughter J.C. Becker , local burgher .

In February 1711 Prince Johann Ernst went University Utrecht .

From 21 February 1713 Bach lodged castle Weissenfels .

Duke Christian’s birthday fell 23 February , known Cantata No .

208 performed year , 1716 .

The earlier date stylistically suitable ; moreover , compatible watermark autograph score fact score Bach contradicted sharp flat rather natural – old-fashioned habit gave progressively 1714 .

About May 1713 young prince returned Utrecht , apparently good deal music , year 1 June bill binding , copying shelving ( music came Halle ) .

In February 1713 Amsterdam , may met blind organist J.J. de Graff habit playing recent Italian concerto keyboard solo .

This may given rise numerous concerto arrangement made Walther Bach .

On 7 September 1713 Bach probably Ohrdruf , standing godfather nephew ; 6 November took part dedication new Jakobskirche Weimar ( evidence composed music ) .

On 27 November Weimar , godfather Trebs’s son .

At time seems gone Halle , perhaps buy music , become accidentally involved authority Liebfrauenkirche .

The organist ( Zachow , Handel’s teacher ) died 1712 , organ enlarged three-manual 65 stop .

The story pieced together hint incomplete correspondence ; look pastor , J.M .

Heineccius , pressed Bach apply vacant post .

Bach may involved planning enlargement organ , Zachow became incapacitated ; event , stayed Halle 28 November 15 December church authorities’ expense .

He also composed performed cantata ( lost ) , attended meeting 13 December 1713 , offered post , let committee suppose accepted , although time find casual fee would amount .

On 14 December sent formal contract .

Bach replied 14 January 1714 , saying cautiously released Weimar , uneasy salary duty , would write within week .

Whether known ; February committee resolved tell salary likely increased .

Thus Halle could expect slightly smaller salary already getting ; attraction organ , twice large .

Bach must approached duke , 2 March , ‘at humble request’ , became Konzertmeister ( ranking vice-Kapellmeister ) , basic salary 250 florin 25 February .

In finally refusing Halle post , probably mentioned figure , committee accused used offer lever extract money duke .

This denied 19 March , letter reasonable obviously honest remained good term Halle employed organ examiner 1716 .

Gottfried Kirchhoff meanwhile appointed organist 30 July 1714 .

Few cantata ( apart secular No .

208 ) ascribed early Weimar year .

Nos.18 , 54 199 appear date 1713 clearly specific connection cantata composed eye church calendar March 1714 onwards .

The work performed Halle December 1713 formerly thought No .

21 ( see F. Chrysander : G.F. Händel ( Leipzig , 1858–67/R ) ) .

The idea No .

63 longer stand , although force required work make extremely unlikely written Weimar court ; performance Halle Christmas 1715 conceivable .

On 23 March 1714 ordered cantata future rehearsed chapel , home lodging ; Palm Sunday , 25 March , Bach performed No .

182 .

This fourth Sunday appointment Konzertmeister , become responsible writing cantata every four week .

As evidently hoped complete annual cycle four year , keep strictly rule ; written cantata Advent Sunday 1714 , wrote last Sunday Trinity 1715 , second Sunday Advent 1716 ( 1717 prison ) .

Apart intentional irregularity , gap series , strange thing gap became suddenly numerous end 1715 .

One gap accounted death Frankfurt 1 August 1715 musically gifted Prince Johann Ernst , plunging duchy mourning 11 August 9 November 1715 , note music might played .

From 1717 cantata .

A tentative explanation suggested ; hard see Bach’s usual allowance paper paid 16 May 1716 known performed church cantata 19 January 6 December .

On 4 April 1716 Bach , like librettist Salomo Franck ‘the book-printer’ , paid ‘Carmina’ , bound green taffeta , ‘presented’ unspecified occasion – perhaps 24 January Duke Ernst August married Eleonore , sister Prince Cöthen .

Ernst’s birthday celebrated April ; two horn player Weissenfels came Weimar , possibly brought repeat performance Cantata No .

208 .

Meanwhile , new organ Halle making progress , 17 April council resolved Bach , Kuhnau Leipzig Rolle Quedlinburg invited examine 29 April .

They accepted ; receive 16 thaler , plus food travelling expense .

The examination began 7 a.m. , lasted three day – time 1 May , expert wrote report , sermon preached fine music performed .

On 2 May organist three examiner met builder discus detail .

The council , behaved liberally , gave tremendous banquet , whose date usually given 3 May ( 1 May seems likely ) .

On 31 July 1716 Bach Arnstadt organ builder signed testimonial J.G .

Schröter , built organ Erfurt .

In 1717 Bach mentioned print first time : preface Mattheson’s Das beschützte Orchestre , dated 21 February , Mattheson referred Bach ‘the famous Weimar organist’ saying work , church keyboard , led one rate highly , asked biographical information .

It background Bach’s departure Weimar considered .

In 1703 employed Duke Johann Ernst ; since return 1708 , Duke Wilhelm , Johann’s elder brother .

The brother bad term , Johann Ernst died 1707 son Ernst came age 1709 , thing became better .

For time ducal disagreement seem affected Bach ; perhaps kept within bound Superintendent Lairitz , Ernst’s younger half-brother ( Johann , composer ) may influence .

But latter died 1715 , Lairitz 4 April 1716 , new superintendent certainly failed cope ‘court difficulties’ ; like rest Wilhelm’s household , forbidden associate Ernst .

The musician , though paid household , threatened fine 10 thaler served Ernst way .

No extant Bach cantata securely dated 19 January 6 December 1716 ; may seem unlikely long , continuous gap due casual loss .

It tempting suppose Bach found position embarrassing ( owing early connection junior court ) expressed disapproval Duke Wilhelm’s behaviour evading responsibility .

In fact , Bach seem disapproved duke’s behaviour discovered new Kapellmeister sought elsewhere .

Drese senior died 1 December 1716 ; son , vice-Kapellmeister , account nonentity .

Bach produced Cantatas nos.70a , 186a 147a 6 , 13 20 December ( three successive week , month ) , , far known .

By Christmas , Bach may found duke angling Telemann .

Negotiations Telemann came nothing ; apparently Bach set looking post Kapellmeister .

He offered one Prince Leopold Cöthen , brother-in-law Duke Ernst ( Bach prince probably met Ernst’s wedding January 1716 ) appointment confirmed 5 August 1717 .

No doubt Bach asked Duke Wilhelm’s permission leave , doubt refused – duke annoyed nephew obviously hand finding Bach job carried prestige , 400 thaler , better paid .

The duke Bach must nevertheless remained speaking term time , date hardly earlier end September Bach Dresden free challenge French keyboard virtuoso Louis Marchand .

Versions affair differ , according Birnbaum ( wrote 1739 , probably Bach’s supervision ) , Bach ‘found himself’ Dresden , sent ‘special coach’ .

Once , court official persuaded challenge Marchand contest harpsichord ; idea compete organ seems crept later .

Whatever may truth detail , universally agreed Marchand ran away .

On birthday , 30 October 1717 , Duke Wilhelm set endowment court musician ; second centenary Reformation celebrated 31 October 2 November .

Presumably Bach took part ceremony , though evidence set libretto Franck provided .

Emboldened , perhaps , Marchand affair , demanded release term duke imprisoned 6 November dismissal disgrace 2 December .

The Cöthen court paid Bach 50 thaler 7 August .

Some supposed travelling expense , Bach wife family moved Cöthen soon ; seems unlikely duke would allowed move agreed let Bach go .

The younger Drese became Kapellmeister father’s place Bach’s pupil J.M .

Schubart became court organist .

The post Konzertmeister disappeared .

Cöthen .

Except last month Weimar period , Bach good term Duke Wilhelm ; relation martinet must always official .

At Cöthen , end 1721 , thing different ; Prince Leopold young man , Bach said , loved understood music .

He born 1694 , Calvinist father Lutheran mother .

The father died 1704 , mother ruled Leopold came age 10 December 1715 .

There court orchestra October 1707 , Leopold persuaded mother take three musician .

While studying Berlin 1708 , met A.R .

Stricker ; end 1710 1713 usual grand tour , studied J.D .

Heinichen Rome .

He returned capable singing bass , playing violin , viola da gamba harpsichord .

The Berlin court orchestra broken 1713 , July 1714 employed Stricker Kapellmeister wife soprano lutenist ; 1716 18 musician .

In August 1717 Stricker wife seem resigned , leaving prince free appoint Bach .

At Cöthen St Jakob organ poor condition .

The court chapel Calvinist ; organist , elaborate music performed , two-manual organ 13 14 stop , though may complete chromatic compass pedal e manual e. The Lutheran St Agnus two-manual organ 27 stop , exceptional pedal compass .

There slightest reason suppose Bach wrote particular work exploit pedal compass , doubt used one organ teaching private practice .

He communicated St Agnus , took part baptism court chapel , official duty either .

He may , however , involved affair May 1719 , cantata put dedication festival St Agnus , 150 copy ( presumably ) libretto printed .

The printer’s bill one thaler eight groschen endorsed pastor : ‘The churchwarden give 16 groschen ; want , must go gave order’ .

Bach’s basic salary , 400 thaler , twice Stricker’s , extra allowance made 450 .

Only one court official paid , evidence Bach held high esteem .

On 17 November 1718 last child first wife ( short-lived son ) named prince , godfather .

Bach’s residence Cöthen definitely known , seems likely began tenant Stiftstrasse 11 ; 1721 , house bought prince’s mother use Lutheran pastor , moved Holzmarkt 10 .

The orchestra needed room weekly rehearsal ; prince supplied paying rent Bach ( 12 thaler year 10 December 1717 1722 ) .

Presumably suitable room Bach’s first house .

Whether continued use room move 1721 , paid rent 1722 , clear .

The date first rent payment suggests Bach household moved Cöthen day two released prison ( 2 December ) ; , hasty rehearsal , helped celebrate prince’s birthday 10 December .

That would normally duty .

The court account suggest something connected birthday either printed bound 1717 , also 1719 1720 ( Anh.7 ) ; Bach certainly wrote cantata 1722 , Cantatas nos.66a Anh.5 1718 .

In 1721 may birthday celebration , prince married , Bernburg , next day .

Cantata No .

173a undoubtedly birthday work , Bach probably wrote left Cöthen ; 36a , arrangement 36c ( 1725 ) , performed Cöthen 30 November 1726 , birthday prince’s second wife .

New Year cantata also expected .

No .

134a date 1719 , Anh.6 1720 , Anh.8 1723 .

There evidence 1718 , 1721 1722 ; printers’ binders’ bill paid 5 January 1722 may music performed December 1721 .

Bach may well unable put wedding cantata , seems reason offered something prince’s birthday .

Nos.184 194 ( Leipzig , 1724 , Störmthal , 1723 ) seem arrangement Cöthen work , perhaps part No .

120 .

Whether Bach performed cantata Cöthen 10 December 1717 , Leipzig 16 December examining organ university church ( Paulinerkirche ) .

The work done Johann Scheibe , whose son Bach later dispute .

Bach known done work kind Cöthen .

On 9 May 1718 prince went drink water Carlsbad five week , taking harpsichord , Bach five musician .

Early 1719 Bach Berlin , negotiating new harpsichord .

About time seems busy composing buying music , July 1719 May 1720 26 thaler spent binding .

During 1719 Handel visited mother Halle , 30 km away ; said Bach tried , failed , make contact .

Bach also disregarded renewed request Mattheson biographical material .

W.F .

Bach nine 1719 ; title-page Clavier-Büchlein dated 22 January 1720 .

In May Bach went Carlsbad prince .

The date return seem recorded ; apparently 7 July , date Maria Barbara’s funeral , reason doubt Emanuel’s story father returned find dead already buried .

His wife nearly 36 .

Her death may well unsettled Bach , even led think returning service church ; practical reason taking interest St Jacobi Hamburg .

The organist , Heinrich Friese , died 12 September 1720 ; Bach known Hamburg youth , must attracted organ , four-manual Schnitger 60 stop .

There evidence Bach actually invited apply post ; may well made inquiry .

At event , name one eight considered 21 November , Hamburg time .

A competition arranged 28 November , Bach leave Cöthen five day .

Three candidate appear , judge satisfied four .

An approach made Bach , committee met 12 December ; Bach’s reply arrived , met week later , found Bach refused .

Perhaps unable , unwilling , contribute 4000 mark church fund , successful candidate actually .

From way committee kept post open Bach , one may suppose heard recital St Katharinen .

Exactly performance arranged , no-one know ; obituary Emanuel stated Bach played aged Reincken , magistracy notable ; played two hour ; extemporized different style chorale An Wasserflüssen Babylon almost half hour , better Hamburg organist accustomed Saturday Vespers .

As fantasia chorale one Reincken’s major work , may seem tactless choice ; obituary make clear chorale chosen ‘those present’ Bach .

Reincken reported said , ‘I thought art dead , I see still life you’ , showed Bach much courtesy .

A later remark Mattheson’s taken imply Bach also played G minor Fugue bwv542 , good reason doubt .

During 1720 Bach made fair copy work unaccompanied violin , must preparing Brandenburg Concertos , whose autograph full score dedicated 24 March 1721 Margrave Christian Ludwig , Bach played Berlin negotiating new Cöthen harpsichord , June 1718 March 1719 .

What played known ; invited send composition .

As said , took ‘a couple years’ commission , submitted six work written exploit resource Cöthen .

Such resource seem available Margrave Brandenburg , really surprising thank Bach , send fee use score .

One Bach’s friend Cöthen goldsmith C.H .

Bähr ; Bach stood godfather one Bähr’s son 1721 , deputized godfather another 1723 .

About beginning August 1721 gave performance unspecified kind Count Heinrich XI Reuss Schleiz ; may arranged J.S .

Koch , Kantor , held post Mühlhausen , though possibly Bach’s time .

On 15 June 1721 Bach 65th communicant St Agnus ; one ‘Mar .

Magd .

Wilken’ 14th .

This may well Bach’s future wife – mistake first name easy one – Anna Magdalena make formal appearance 25 September , Bach first two among five godparent child called Hahn .

This baptism recorded three register .

In two Anna described ‘court singer’ , third , simply ‘chamber musician’ ( Musicantin ) .

In September Anna godmother , child called Palmarius ; register differ describing occupation .

Her name appear court account summer 1722 , referred Kapellmeister’s wife ; salary ( half Bach’s ) noted paid May June 1722 .

Practically nothing known early year .

She born 22 September 1701 Zeitz .

Her father , Johann Caspar Wilcke , court trumpeter ; worked Zeitz February 1718 , moved Weissenfels died 30 November 1731 .

The surname variously spelt .

Anna’s mother ( Margaretha Elisabeth Liebe , 7 March 1746 ) daughter organist sister J.S .

Liebe , besides trumpeter , organist two church Zeitz 1694 death 1742 .

As trumpeter’s daughter , Anna may well met Bach 's socially .

The story public figure , sung Cöthen local court since age 15 , discredited ; said arisen confusion elder brother , trumpeter .

However , paid singing , father , chapel Zerbst occasion Easter midsummer 1721 .

By September 1721 , aged 20 , Cöthen , well acquainted Bach ( aged 36 ) , ready marry 3 December .

The prince saved Bach 10 thaler giving permission married lodging .

At time Bach paid two visit city cellar , bought first one firkin Rhine wine , later two firkin , cut price , 27 instead 32 groschen per gallon .

On 11 December 1721 prince married cousin Friderica , Princess Anhalt-Bernburg .

The marriage followed five week illumination entertainment Cöthen .

This however auspicious event Bach : leave Cöthen partly princess ‘eine Amusa’ ( someone interested Muses ) broke happy relationship Bach husband .

Perhaps unfortunate influence made felt even married .

A legacy Tobias Lämmerhirt ( Bach’s maternal uncle ) facilitated Bach’s first marriage ; Tobias’s widow buried Erfurt 12 September 1721 , Bach received something , though time second marriage .

On 24 January 1722 Bach’s sister Maria , together one Lämmerhirts , challenged , saying Bach brother Jacob ( Sweden ) Christoph ( Ohrdruf ) agreed ( Christoph died 1721 ) .

Bach heard accident ; 15 March wrote Erfurt council behalf Jacob well .

He objected sister’s action , said absent brother desired due .

On 16 April Jacob died ; matter seems settled line towards end year .

Bach’s legacy must amounted rather year’s pay .

In summer 1722 Kapellmeister court Anhalt-Zerbst , Bach commissioned write birthday cantata prince ; paid 10 thaler April May .

The birthday August , payment made month presumably refer performance .

If , work , seems disappeared , scored two oboe d’amore ‘other instruments’ .

Several didactic work keyboard belong Cöthen period .

One Clavierbüchlein Anna Magdalena Bach .

25 leaf extant , third original manuscript ; kind title-page , Anna Magdalena ( probably ) wrote title date Bach ( certainly ) noted title three theological book .

Despite sceptic , remains reasonable suppose Bach gave book wife early 1722 .

It seems filled 1725 .

The autograph Das wohltemperirte Clavier ( book 1 ‘48’ ) dated 1722 title-page 1732 end .

The writing uniform style , various reason incredible finish manuscript 1732 .

This handsome fair copy preceded draft , like W.F .

Bach’s Clavier-Büchlein ( begun 1720 ) ; movement look earlier .

Presumably Bach brought together convenience , partly serve last step keyboard course , partly exhibit advantage equal temperament .

As book 2 , doubt Bach transposed piece fill gap key scheme ; odd pairing prelude six flat fugue six sharp suggests former originally E minor , latter D minor .

The title-page almost certainly part Orgel-Büchlein Bach wrote Cöthen , another educational work best mentioned .

It meant collection chorale prelude , ordinary church season also occasion subject Lord’s Prayer , Penitence , emphasized .

The paper kind Bach used , far known , 1714 .

A item date 1740 ; rest , writing resembles cantata 1715–16 .

Of 164 prelude Bach allowed , completed fewer 50 .

Last group work come Inventions Sinfonias , whose autograph fair copy dated ‘Cöthen , 1723’ .

Its content already appeared , earlier version different title , W.F .

Bach’s Clavier-Büchlein 1720 .

The story Bach’s move Leipzig begin death Kuhnau , Kantor Thomasschule , 5 June 1722 .

Six men applied post , among Telemann , still remembered good work done Leipzig 20 year .

He similar job Hamburg year , probably famous German musician actually living Germany .

One Kantor’s duty teach Latin .

Telemann refused ; nevertheless , appointed 13 August .

But Hamburg authority would release , offered increase pay ; November declined Leipzig post .

At meeting 23 November Councillor Platz said Telemann loss ; needed Kantor teach subject besides music .

Of remaining five candidate , three invited give trial performance ; two dropped , one would teach Latin .

By 21 December two Kapellmeisters applied , Bach Graupner .

The candidate Kauffmann Merseburg , Schott Leipzig Neukirche , Rolle Magdeburg .

Of five candidate , Graupner preferred ; reputable musician , studied Thomasschule .

He successfully performed test ( two cantata ) 17 January 1723 .

But 23 March withdrew , offered pay Darmstadt .

Meanwhile , Bach performed test piece ( Cantatas nos.22 23 ) 7 February 1723 .

Rolle Schott also heard , possibly Kauffmann .

The Princess Cöthen died 4 April , late affect Bach’s decision .

On 9 April council considered Bach , Kauffmann Schott .

Like Telemann , none wished teach Latin .

Councillor Platz said best men could got , must make mediocre .

The council evidently resolved approach Bach , 13 April obtained written permission leave Cöthen .

On 19 April signed curious document read yet free Cöthen , could free within month ; also said willing pay deputy teach Latin .

On 22 April council agreed Bach , one hoping music would theatrical .

On 5 May came person sign agreement ; 8 13 May interviewed sworn ecclesiastical authority ; 15 May first instalment salary paid ; 16 May ‘took duties’ university church , possibly Cantata No .

59 .

With family furniture , moved 22 May , performed Cantata No .

75 Nikolaikirche 30 May .

On 1 June , 8.30 a.m. , formally presented school .

This story told detail , throw light circumstance Bach worked Leipzig .

To , Kantorate step downwards social scale , little respect employer .

To council , Bach third-rater , mediocrity , would expected Kantor – teach Latin , well organize city church music .

The stage set trouble , due course trouble came .

Councillor Platz Telemann curiously echoed Councillor Stieglitz , ten day Bach’s death : ‘The school need Kantor , Kapellmeister ; though certainly ought understand music’ .

[ Top pageTop page ] 7 .

Leipzig , 1723–9 .

The position Kantor Thomasschule , held conjointly civic director music , associated wealth tradition since 16th century .

It one notable position German musical life esteem commanded ; little doubt general attractiveness position played part – likely decisive part – Bach’s decision move Cöthen Leipzig .

His subsequent remark social step Kapellmeister Kantor must seen context later disagreement Leipzig authority , indeed letter question ( Erdmann , friend youth , 28 October 1730 ) make unequivocally clear .

In event , Bach Kapellmeister apply post .

The duty incomparably varied demanding Cöthen Weimar ( say nothing Mühlhausen Arnstadt ) le corresponded undertaken Telemann Hamburg .

It mere chance Bach wanted tackle range duty comparable friend .

Above must preferred greater economic political stability commercial metropolis governed democratically uncertainty court absolute prince , personal whim often held sway .

The university – foremost German-speaking world time – must another special attraction eye father growing-up son .

The ‘Cantor zu St. Thomae et Director Musices Lipsiensis’ important musician town ; , primarily responsible music four principal Leipzig church – Thomaskirche , Nikolaikirche , Matthäeikirche ( Neukirche ) Petrikirche – well aspect town’s musical life controlled town council .

In carrying task could call pupil Thomasschule , boarding-school attached Thomaskirche , whose musical training responsibility , well town’s professional musician .

Normally pupil , 50 60 number , split four choir class ( Kantoreien ) four church .

The requirement would vary class class : polyphonic music required Thomaskirche , Nikolaikirche ( civic church ) Matthäeikirche , figural music first two ; Petrikirche monodic chant sung .

The first choir class , best 12 16 singer , directed Kantor , sang alternately two principal church , Nikolaikirche Thomaskirche ; class charge prefect , appointed Bach , would older therefore experienced pupil Thomasschule .

Musical aptitude decisive factor selection pupil Thomasschule , Kantor’s responsibility ass train .

This furthered daily singing lesson , mostly given Kantor .

There also instrumental instruction ablest pupil , Bach provide free charge thus enabled make good shortage instrumentalist performance .

Indeed , number professional musician employed town ( four Stadtpfeifer , three fiddler one apprentice ) held throughout period office level obtained 17th century .

For instrumentalist Bach drew university student .

In general age Thomasschule pupil ranged 12 23 .

Remembering voice broke age 17 18 , clear Bach could count solo treble alto already ten years’ practical experience – ideal situation , impossible boys’ choir today .

As far church music concerned , Bach’s duty centred principal service Sundays church feast , well important subsidiary service , especially Vespers .

In addition , could asked music wedding funeral , would receive special fee .

Such additional income important Bach , salary Kantor Thomaskirche director music came 87 thaler 12 groschen ( besides allowance wood candle , payment kind , corn wine ) .

In fact , including payment endowment bequest well additional income , Bach received annually 700 thaler .

Further , use spacious official residence south wing Thomasschule , renovated cost 100 thaler moved 1723 .

Inside Kantor’s residence so-called ‘Komponirstube’ ( ‘composing room’ ) , professional office containing personal music library school’s .

The building old Thomasschule , scandalously , demolished 1903 make room senior minister’s quarter ; also west façade Thomaskirche rebuilt neo-Gothic style .

During early Leipzig year , Bach involved church music particular thoroughness extreme energy .

This activity centred ‘Hauptmusic’ composed Sundays church feast .

The performance polyphonic cantata , text related rule Gospel day , tradition inherited previous Kantors .

Even , Bach engaged musical enterprise without parallel Leipzig’s musical history : relatively short time composed five complete ( nearly complete ) cycle cantata Church year , 60 cantata , making repertory roughly 300 sacred cantata .

The first two cycle prepared immediately , 1723–4 1724–5 ; third took rather longer , composed 1725 1727 .

The fourth , text Picander , appears date 1728–9 , fifth must occupied longer period , possibly extending 1740s .

The established chronology Bach’s vocal work make clear main body cantata existence 1729 , Bach’s development cantata effectively complete 1735 .

The existence fourth fifth cycle questioned , fragmentary survival compared almost complete survival first , second third ; positive argument non-existence put forward number five cycle , laid obituary 1754 , must stand .

Compared high proportion Bach’s work kind lost ( orchestral chamber music , instance ) , disappearance 100 cantata would exceptional .

( The preservation Bach’s work discussed , §11 ; see §15 correspondence excess chorale Breitkopf collection 1784–7 number lost cantata . )

The first cycle begin first Sunday Trinity 1723 Cantata No .

75 , performed ‘mit gutem applausu’ Nikolaikirche , followed No .

76 , second Sunday Trinity , performed Thomaskirche .

The two largest church Leipzig Gothic style , Bach’s time contained stone wooden gallery .

The choir loft west wall nave council gallery .

The organ choir loft ( ‘Schüler-Chor’ ) : Nikolaikirche Thomaskirche three-manual organ 36 35 stop respectively ( Oberwerk , Brustwerk , Rückpositiv , Pedal ) .

The Thomaskirche second organ , fitted east wall ‘swallow’s nest’ , 21 stop ( Oberwerk , Brustwerk , Rückpositiv , Pedal ) ; fell dilapidation demolished 1740 .

The organ always played cantata performance , would provide continuo accompaniment ; played respective organist church ; Bach’s term office Christian Heinrich Gräbner ( Thomaskirche 1729 ) , J.G .

Görner ( Nikolaikirche 1729 , Thomaskirche ) Johann Schneider ( Nikolaikirche 1729 ) .

Bach , held regular appointment organist since time Weimar , directed choir orchestra , would normally playing organ .

However , frequently must directed church ensemble harpsichord , documented performance bwv198 1727 .

At rate , harpsichord often , regularly , employed continuo instrument addition organ .

The cantata integral part Leipzig Lutheran liturgy .

It followed immediately reading Gospel , preceding Creed sermon ( second part two-part cantata would follow sermon , ‘sub communione’ ) .

Apart organ playing congregational singing hymn , selected Kantor , musical constituent liturgy introit motet , would taken Florilegium Portense ( 1618 ) Erhard Bodenschatz , collection mainly drawn 16th century ( Lassus , Handl etc .

) , performed cappella harpsichord continuo .

Services began 7 a.m. lasted three hour ; allowed mere half-hour cantata , Bach rarely overstepped duration .

The normal performing force consisted 16 singer 18 instrumentalist ; precise number varied according work , rare total number singer player fall 25 exceed 40 ( figure required exceptional occasion , like St Matthew Passion , demanded two Kantoreien double normal number instrumentalist ) .

Ordinarily performing force consisted four group : pupil Thomasschule ( first Kantorei ) ; eight salaried town musician , 1734 headed J.G .

Reiche thereafter J.C. Gentzmer ; University student ( principally Bach’s private pupil ) ; additional assistant ( probably regularly including one two paid soloist ) guest .

Bach took additional duty musical director university , post traditionally held Thomaskantor , summer 1723 , perhaps early 16 May , performance Cantata No .

59 university church , Paulinerkirche , event 9 August , performed Latin Ode bwv Anh.20 ( lost ) university’s festivity marking birthday Duke Friedrich II Saxe-Gotha .

The major part duty university comprised musical provision so-called quarter-day oration ‘old’ service Paulinerkirche , employing pupil Thomasschule town musician four major festival Christmas Day , Easter Day , Whit Sunday Reformation Day ; Bach paid 2 thaler 6 groschen occasion .

He carried important civic duty first time 30 August 1723 , introduced Cantata No .

119 part annual celebration change town council .

The enormous scope Bach’s new responsibility , well vast workload , may gauged fact day ( 14th Sunday Trinity ) Cantata No .

25 heard first time , first performance No .

138 ( 15th Sunday ) soon follow .

September 1723 saw start Bach’s protracted wrangle university .

In written request payment , laid claim traditional right Thomaskantor responsible ‘old’ service quarter-day oration .

The university , however , wanted combine duty responsibility ‘new’ service ( normal Sundays holy day ) , April 1723 entrusted J.G .

Görner , organist Nikolaikirche , together title ‘Musikdirektor’ .

On 28 September Bach’s request turned , paid half fee .

He would give , turned Elector Saxony Dresden three petition .

Following intervention Dresden court , university decided put Görner charge ‘new’ service , awarded Bach traditional right payment .

Thereafter , regular fee payment prove , Bach retained responsibility ‘old’ service quarter-day oration 1750 .

About 2 November 1723 Bach inaugurated new organ ( previously appraised ) Störmthal , outside Leipzig , Cantata No .

194 .

Then , second Sunday Advent fourth , came first break weekly routine composing performing cantata ; Leipzig , unlike Weimar , period ‘tempus clausum’ , Lent including Palm Sunday .

On Christmas Day figural music returned , particularly splendid manner , Cantata No .

63 D major Sanctus bwv238 main service Magnificat bwv243a Vespers ; Bach’s first large-scale composition Latin text customary Leipzig major feast day .

At point calendar duty unimaginably heavy , yet carried incomparable creative vigour , producing Cantatas nos.40 64 feast St Stephen St John Evangelist , No .

190 New Year , No .

153 Sunday New Year ( 2 January 1724 ) , No .

65 Epiphany ( 6 January ) No .

154 following Sunday ( 9 January ) ; , normal weekly service resumed .

During next ‘tempus clausum’ Bach composed first large-scale choral work Leipzig , St John Passion , first performed Vespers Nikolaikirche Good Friday ( 7 April ) .

This Vespers service introduced specially performance Passion 1721 ; year Kuhnau’s St Mark Passion ( lost ) performed .

Performances alternated annually Thomaskirche Nikolaikirche , arrangement Bach strictly adhered .

There documentary evidence Passion performance Bach’s direction Good Friday 1723 , older dating St John Passion derives .

The work several performance , time greatly altered version ( see §14 ) : 30 March 1725 ( second version adapted annual cycle cantata ) , probably 11 April 1732 ( third version ) 4 April 1749 ( fourth version ) ; 1739 Bach undertook revision work remained unfinished .

With first Sunday Trinity 1724 ( 11 June ) Bach began second cycle ; chorale cantata .

Not least included work composed Weimar , first cycle thoroughly heterogeneous character , musically textually , Bach gave new cycle unifying concept , work based text , melody , hymnbook .

Unfortunately series chorale cantata , beginning No .

20 , O Ewigkeit , du Donnerwort , programmatic overture , interrupted early 1725 Bach complete cycle .

On 25 June Gera dedication organ Salvatorkirche .

In July went Cöthen Anna Magdalena guest appearance performer ; retained title Court Kapellmeister , lapsed death Prince Leopold 1728 .

There evidence visit Cöthen , Bach performing alongside wife ( sang soprano ) , December 1725 January 1728 .

During 1725 Bach started prepare second Clavierbüchlein Anna Magdalena .

On 23 February 1725 performed Cantata No .

249a Weissenfels court birthday Duke Christian ; original version Easter Oratorio bwv249 , first given Leipzig following 1 April .

No .

249a represents beginning long-standing collaboration fluent Leipzig poet Christian Friedrich Henrici ( Picander ) , chief supplier text Bach’s later Leipzig vocal work .

Bach produced congratulatory cantata two Leipzig University professor May August ( nos.36c 205 ) .

On 19–20 September played Silbermann organ Dresden Sophienkirche local court musician , thus continuing practice giving virtuoso organ performance concert tour – undoubtedly Leipzig , , although longer held post organist .

His favourite instrument Leipzig evidently great organ Paulinerkirche built Johann Scheibe 1716 , 53 stop , three manual ( Hauptwerk , Seitenwerk Brustwerk ) pedal ; Bach one examiner 1717 .

Early 1726 – third cycle , started June 1725 – interruption Bach’s production cantata , reason remain obscure : February September 1726 performed 18 cantata cousin ( 6 ) Johann Ludwig Bach ( 3/72 ) .

In particular , Purification fourth Sunday Easter , performed none music main Sunday service ; even Good Friday used work another composer , Reinhard Keiser’s St Mark Passion , performed , Weimar .

Difficulties performer may partly responsible ; instrumental force required J.L .

Bach’s cantata modest Bach normally used .

Even apart , however , pattern Bach’s cantata production – far judged available material – changed third cycle ; considerable gap early period Trinity Sunday 1725 , seems third cycle , unlike first two , extended two year .

In gap , cantata composer performance Bach’s work given .

Michaelmas 1726 saw appearance print Partita No .

1 , general title Clavier-Übung : Bach began activity , later increase scope , publisher keyboard music .

Partita No .

1 , published singly , followed nos.2 3 ( 1727 ) , No .

4 ( 1728 ) , No .

5 ( 1730 ) No .

6 ( 1730 1731 ; copy known ) .

Evidently series originally planned comprise seven partita .

There early version nos.3 6 second book Anna Magdalena 1725 .

Bach sent No .

1 , dedicatory poem , Cöthen court form congratulation birth heir , Prince Emanuel Ludwig ( born 12 September 1726 ) .

In December 1726 , installation Dr Gottlieb Kortte university professor , Bach produced sizable occasional work , dramma per musica , Cantata No .

207 .

In 1727 Bach composed two extremely important work .

The St Matthew Passion , double choir libretto Picander , performed Good Friday ( 11 April ; evidence repeated Thomaskirche 1729 , 1736 1742 ; see §14 ) .

The work Trauer Ode ( Cantata No .

198 ) , performed October memorial ceremony , planned university , death Electress Christiane Eberhardine , remained Protestant husband , August Strong Saxony , converted Roman Catholicism .

For Bach commissioned set text Leipzig professor poetry , Johann Christoph Gottsched .

This became somewhat controversial affair , university director music , Görner , felt slighted .

Bach however retained commission performed two part work , ‘composed Italian manner’ , directing harpsichord , university church , 17 October .

Between 7 September 1727 6 January 1728 period national mourning , musical performance .

In September 1728 brief dispute church authority flared .

The sub-deacon , Gaudlitz , demanded choose hymn sung sermon Vespers ; usual Kantor select hymn , Bach felt right encroached upon .

The dispute settled sub-deacon’s favour .

Bach must seen setback , grievance met ; relation ecclesiastical authority whole good throughout time Leipzig .

His relation town council head teacher Thomasschule went le smoothly , become even difficult 1730s .

Documents dealing various dispute show Bach stubborn defender prerogative office frequently reacted excessive violence often blame negative outcome .

It would wrong , however , draw hasty inference Bach’s personality relation world .

It unfortunate half Bach’s surviving correspondence concerned generally trivial often protracted dispute right .

This material extant public archive , utterance kind appropriate archival preservation , might complemented rather austere view personality , survived small quantity .

From Bach’s behaviour dispute seen , pressure , would defy bureaucratic regulation order preserve independence clear artistic breathing-space .

His taking collegium musicum 1729 , directed management , must seen context , represents something incidental biographical fact .

Early 1729 Bach spent time Weissenfels court connection birthday celebration February Duke Christian , long associated .

On occasion title court Kapellmeister Saxe-Weissenfels conferred ( Cöthen title lately expired ) ; retained title 1736 .

At end March went Cöthen perform funeral music former employer ; text survives large-scale work four part ( bwv244a ) , much music reconstructed consists parody bwv198 244 .

On 15 April ( Good Friday ) St Matthew Passion performed Thomaskirche .

On second day Whit week ( 6 June ) , probably last cantata Picander cycle performed , No .

174 .

The manuscript , uniquely Bach , dated ( ‘1729’ ) ; perhaps represents sort final gesture heavy , six-year involvement cantata composition .

Beside production cantata , Passions vocal occasional work , sacred secular , instrumental music retreated background Bach’s first year Leipzig .

Apart keyboard Chamber music ( including sonata harpsichord violin bwv1014–19 ) appear relatively small number organ work ( prelude fugue , trio sonata ) hard date individually primarily connected Bach’s activity recitalist .

In June 1729 invitation visit Leipzig delivered Handel , Halle , Wilhelm Friedemann , place father ill time ; nothing came .

Thus Bach’s second last attempt establish contact highly esteemed London colleague met failure .

Significantly , case initiative taken Bach .

[ Top pageTop page ] 8 .

Leipzig , 1729–39 .

On appointment director collegium musicum , decisive change came Bach’s activity Leipzig ; time new possibility opened .

The collegium founded Telemann 1702 recently directed G.B .

Schott ( left become Kantor Gotha March 1729 ) ; voluntary association professional musician university student gave regular weekly ( fair season even frequent ) public concert .

Such society played important part flowering bourgeois musical culture 18th century , highly reputed ensemble , important commercial centre Leipzig , Bach made contribution .

He took direction third Sunday Easter – word , April 1729 – retained first place 1737 ; resumed year 1739 .

He must strong reason wanting take fresh area work addition duty .

To extent possible guess reason .

For six year immersed production sacred music , created stock work sufficient supply requirement remaining time office .

In effort provide sacred music fastidious comprehensive met little appreciation authority , additional facility ( example , much needed professional instrumentalist ) placed disposal : would understandable felt resigned situation .

Further , former Kapellmeister , must attracted prospect working good instrumental ensemble , another important incentive must thought , director collegium , would able establish wholly independent musical praxis , accordance idea .

It known whether new position brought additional income .

Nothing , unfortunately , known programme ‘ordinaire’ weekly concert .

But surviving performing part work orchestral suite bwv1066–8 , violin concerto bwv1041–3 flute sonata bwv1030 1039 demonstrate Bach performed many Cöthen instrumental work ( revised form ) well new composition .

The seven harpsichord concerto bwv1052–8 , collected together Leipzig manuscript , also belong context .

Bach often performed work composer well , including five orchestral suite cousin Johann Ludwig , secular cantata Handel Porpora flute quartet Telemann wrote Paris .

Further , Bach’s many musical acquaintance place must made frequent appearance , including colleague Dresden court orchestra ( evidence visit J.A .

Bach’s remark ‘it seldom musical master passed [ Leipzig ] without getting know father playing him’ must refer performance collegium musicum , took place Wednesdays 4 6 p.m. coffee-garden ‘before Grimmisches Thor’ summer Fridays 8 10 p.m. Zimmermann’s coffee-house winter .

In addition , ‘extraordinaire’ concert , mark special event ; occasion , 1730s , Bach performed large-scale secular cantata .

His activity collegium must made heavy demand , reduction production sacred music easy understand .

This , however , mean interest sacred music diminished ( Blume , G1963 , claimed , undue emphasis light revised dating work ) .

Such view contradicted major ecclesiastical work written 1730 also simple fact , throughout period office , Bach provided performance cantata , repertory largely completed 1729 , every Sunday two main Leipzig church .

His reference ‘onus’ undertaking , connection performance Passion planned 1739 , might well made 1720s .

Admittedly , difficulty became particularly acute around 1730 , important memorandum 23 August 1730 , dealing state church music Leipzig outlining remedy , testifies .

His letter 28 October year , old friend Erdmann Danzig , may read sense ; sheer frustration memorandum proved ineffectual drove consider leaving Leipzig .

It would seem work collegium musicum yet brought intended equilibrium activity .

The situation aggravated , external factor .

The old headmaster Johann Heinrich Ernesti died 1729 ( Bach performed motet bwv226 funeral October ) .

During subsequent interim Thomasschule’s direction organization school life disturbed .

Problems space appear arisen .

It context complaint made Bach’s neglect school duty ( dropping singing lesson , absence journey without leave ) ; August 1730 even question reducing salary ‘because Kantor incorrigible’ .

It would appear thing put right J.M .

Gesner , took headship school summer , seems soon established friendly familiar relation Bach .

On Good Friday 1730 Bach apparently performed St Luke Passion , composition .

From 25 27 June bicentenary Augsburg Confession celebrated across Lutheran Germany , Bach wrote three cantata event ( nos.190a , 120b , Anh.4a : parody cantata ) .

They untypical church composition period , put together parody ; true also major vocal work like St Mark Passion , B minor Mass , small mass Christmas Oratorio .

The sacred cantata Bach composed entirely new work 1729 nos.117 ( 1728–31 ) , 192 ( 1730 ) , 112 140 ( 1731 ) , 177 ( 1732 ) , 97 ( 1734 ) , 9 100 ( 1732–5 ) 14 ( 1735 ) .

In 1731 collected edition six partita appeared Op .

1 , title I.Teil der Clavier-Übung .

From form word clear Bach planned ‘parts’ series ‘keyboard exercises’ , proceeded produce .

His new continuing interest publishing composition clear sign new determination regard independent freely creative activity .

The first performance St Mark Passion , predominantly parody work , took place Good Friday year .

At end June 1731 Bach family move temporary quarter rebuilding extension work carried Thomasschule .

His residence must become increasingly cramped , family growing .

In early year Leipzig Anna Magdalena borne child almost every year , survived infancy : Christiana Sophia Henrietta ( b spring 1723 ; 29 June 1726 ) Gottfried Heinrich ( 48 ) Christian Gottlieb ( bap .

But Bach’s family life must harmonious one sense ; 1730 reported , proud paterfamilias , family could form vocal instrumental concert ensemble .

The family moved back refurbished apartment next April .

The school reconsecrated 5 June 1732 cantata , bwv Anh.18 .

In September 1731 Bach Dresden first performance Hasse’s opera Cleofide give concert Sophienkirche court ( enthusiastic report newspaper ) .

In September 1732 went wife Kassel examination inauguration organ Martinskirche , probably played ‘Dorian’ Toccata Fugue D minor bwv538 .

With death Elector Friedrich August I Saxony 1 February 1733 five-month period national mourning began .

However , collegium musicum obtained permission restart performance middle June , new harpsichord introduced ( possibly harpsichord concerto bwv1052–8 ) .

During mourning period Bach composed D major version Magnificat bwv243 , probably first heard Leipzig mourning ended 2 July ( Visitation ) .

Above worked Kyrie Gloria B minor Mass , , hope obtaining title court Kapelle , presented new Elector Friedrich August II Dresden , note dated 27 July 1733 , Missa set part .

There evidence suggest Missa performed time , perhaps Sophienkirche Dresden , W.F .

Bach working organist since June 1733 .

Not November 1736 , however , title ‘Hofkomponist’ conferred Bach , even intervention patron Count Keyserlingk letter application .

As gesture thanks , Bach paid respect Dresden royal household enthusiastic public two-hour organ recital new Silbermann instrument Frauenkirche 1 December 1736 .

After dedication Missa July 1733 , Bach kept Saxon royal family’s interest mind ‘extraordinaire’ concert collegium musicum .

During following Christmas season Bach gave people Leipzig chance hear much music secular festive cantata modified form , Christmas Oratorio , heard six section Christmas Day 1734 Epiphany 1735 ( consisted predominantly parody Cantatas nos.213–15 ) .

On 21 November 1734 new headmaster Thomasschule , Johann August Ernesti , greeted cantata , bwv Anh.19 ( Gesner moved newly founded University Göttingen first dean ) .

Bach’s dealing director school untroubled four year , thanks friendly relation Gesner ; Ernesti experienced violent controversy entire period Thomaskantor .

A dispute flared August 1736 authority nominate choral prefect , interest Kantor headmaster diametrically opposed .

With neo-humanist educational ideal , placed priority high academic standard , Ernesti showed little appreciation musical tradition .

The tendency Thomasschule , least start Bach’s period office , restrict musical activity , rate reduce proportion ; Bach , hand , demanded best-qualified pupil assist , certainly must often overburdened ( music copying , rehearsal ) .

Against extent unfair argument headmaster’s part , struggle doomed failure .

The grievance arising nomination choir prefect taken court Dresden ; affair , led Bach’s disciplinary difficulty pupil , settled early 1738 ( precise outcome recorded ) .

The prefect question , Johann Gottlob Krause , Bach refused acknowledge , already left Thomasschule 1737 .

Among important event 1735 appearance second part Clavier-Übung Easter .

In context Bach’s activity publisher also mentioned 1729 also involved distribution musical publication author kept stock , including Heinichen’s book figured bass , Walther’s Lexicon keyboard work Hurlebusch , Krebs son .

On 19 May Ascension Oratorio ( Cantata No .

In June travelled Mühlhausen , spent part early career , appraise rebuilt organ Marienkirche , son Johann Gottfried Bernhard ( 47 ) appointed organist .

During Advent 1735 , music performed , Lent 1736 Bach probably engaged revision St Matthew Passion making carefully laid-out fair copy new version .

In form , characterized writing double chorus ( two continuo part ) , work performed Thomaskirche 30 March 1736 , cantus firmus part opening closing chorus part 1 played ‘swallow’s nest’ organ .

Also Easter Schemelli Hymnbook , whose tune figured bass Bach collaborated , published .

In summer 1737 Bach temporarily resigned direction collegium musicum .

For last ‘extraordinaire’ concert 7 October 1736 written congratulatory Cantata No .

206 birthday elector .

Only two work homage known 1737–8 ( bwv30a Anh.13 ) , indicates Bach occupied primarily thing time release work associated collegium .

He turned keyboard music , working second part Das wohltemperirte Clavier , third part Clavier-Übung , largest keyboard work .

This collection organ piece , freely composed , based chorale , large-scale work church organ small-scale one domestic instrument , appeared Michaelmas 1739 .

Bach obviously also devoted previously private teaching late 1730s .

In October 1737 Bach’s nephew Johann Elias ( 39 ) came live family , private secretary tutor younger child ; remained 1742 .

The surviving draft letter prepared give lively picture Bach’s correspondence year – cause regret period similarly documented .

At period Bach gave especially close attention study work composer .

He subscriber Telemann’s Parisian flute quartet May 1738 ; typical preoccupation Latin polyphonic liturgical composition .

The stile antico tradition seems held particular fascination .

In first place owed knowledge repertory , marginally contributed making transcription ( work Palestrina , Caldara , Bassani others ) , connection Dresden .

His knowledge Pergolesi’s Stabat mater 1736 , reworked 1740s setting Psalm li , Tilge , Höchster , meine Sünden bwv1083 also surprising ; earliest trace Pergolesi’s work north Alps thus lead Bach – sign latter’s remarkable knowledge repertory .

His interest Latin liturgical music also relates closely composition short mass ( Kyrie Gloria ) bwv233–6 .

These may written Protestant court service Dresden , would exclude performance Leipzig .

On 14 May 1737 J.A .

Scheibe , journal Der critische Musikus , published weighty criticism Bach’s manner composition .

This seems come severe blow Bach .

Evidently urging , Leipzig lecturer rhetoric Johann Abraham Birnbaum responded defence , printed January 1738 , Bach distributed among friend acquaintance .

The affair developed public controversy , literary conduct , least , suspended 1739 polemical writing Scheibe Birnbaum .

Scheibe acknowledged Bach’s extraordinary skill performer organ harpsichord , sharply criticized composition , claiming Bach ‘by bombastic intricate procedure deprived naturalness obscured beauty excess art’ .

Birnbaum’s particularly skilful reply fail recognize true problem , lie clash irreconcilable stylistic ideal .

Nevertheless , discussion naturalness artificiality Bach’s style , definition harmony accumulation counterpoint , make important statement premiss unique character Bach’s compositional art , Bach must involved formulation .

This clear way ‘the nature music’ represented , reference biographical detail ( challenge Marchand ) express mention composer work Bach’s library ( Palestrina , Lotti Grigny ) .

The controversy smouldered several year .

Mizler , , shook lance , pointing ‘the latest taste’ Bach’s cantata style ( ‘so well Kapellmeister know suit listeners’ ) .

In end Scheibe climbed , conciliatory review ( 1745 ) Italian Concerto apologized handsomely ( ‘I great man injustice’ ) .

Leipzig , 1739–50 .

In October 1739 Bach resumed direction collegium musicum , meantime charge C.G .

Gerlach ( organist Neukirche pupil Bach ) .

A composition birthday elector ( 7 October ; music lost ) date time , would seem Bach’s ambition activity connection ‘ordinaire’ ‘extraordinaire’ concert considerably diminished .

There performance congratulatory cantata , probably repeat earlier work .

There sign , however , Bach’s interest instrumental ensemble music slackened ; anything , underwent certain revival continued produce chamber music steadily throughout 1730s .

Bach withdrew collegium musicum 1741 .

With death coffee-house owner Gottfried Zimmermann ( 30 May 1741 ) collegium lost landlord organizer , without could long continue , least run hitherto .

Signs reduced activity traced 1744 , possible Bach still presided performance time time year .

The collegium made important contribution musical life Leipzig 40 year , without Bach’s leadership , even demise without consequence future .

In function membership served prepare ground new focal point civic musical life , Grosses Concert , founded 1743 line Parisian Concert Spirituel destined immediate predecessor Gewandhaus concert .

In August 1741 Bach went Berlin , probably visit Carl Philipp Emanuel 1738 appointed court harpsichord player Crown Prince Frederick Prussia ( later Frederick Great ) .

In two previous year Bach made brief journey Halle ( early 1740 ) Altenburg ( September 1739 ; gave recital new Trost organ castle church ) .

In November 1741 journey , time Dresden , visited Count von Keyserlingk .

In year , probably autumn , ‘Aria 30 Variations’ , so-called Goldberg Variations , appeared print .

Bach’s visit Dresden may lie behind anecdote related Forkel , according variation commissioned count mean ameliorating sleepless night , lack formal dedication original edition suggests work composed commission .

It conceivable , hand , publication count received copy work use young resident harpsichord player Johann Gottlieb Goldberg , pupil J.S .

W.F .

Bach .

In copy ( came light 1975 ) Bach added series 14 enigmatically notated canon bass Aria ( bwv1087 ) 1747–8 .

They place special individual accent canonic writing occupied intensively period .

On 30 August 1742 , Kleinzschocher estate near Leipzig , ‘Cantata burlesque’ ( known Peasant Cantata , No .

212 ) performed homage new lord manor , Carl Heinrich von Dieskau ; work unique Bach’s output folklike manner ( except perhaps quodlibet Goldberg Variations ) .

The thoroughly up-to-date characteristic part work show Bach intimately acquainted musical fashion time also knew adapt element younger generation’s style purpose ( also third movement trio sonata Musical Offering ) .

Alongside work , apparently last secular cantata , Bach’s vocal composition 1740s isolated sacred work ( including Cantatas nos.118 , 195 , 197 200 ) , new , refashioned .

There evidence , hand , gave numerous performance work composer , newly arranged revised .

These included German parody Pergolesi’s Stabat mater ( Tilge , Höchster , meine Sünden bwv1083 , c1745–7 ) , Latin parody Sanctus ‘Osanna’ J.C. Kerll’s Missa superba ( Sanctus D bwv241 , c1747–8 ) , Handel’s Brockes Passion ( c1746–7 1748–9 ) pasticcio Passion C.H .

Graun ( inserted movement bwv1088 ‘Der Gerechte kömmt um’ bc C 8 ) .

Bach also often repeated earlier sacred work .

Evidence exist form complete picture , included revised version St Matthew St John Passions ; latter performed last time Bach’s lifetime Good Friday 1749 .

The new vocal composition size Credo following section Mass , , added Missa 1773 ( bwv232I ) , produced B minor Mass – continuation Bach’s preoccupation Latin figural music late 1730s .

No specific reason composition B minor Mass , evidence projected actual performance , far come light .

One plausible hypothesis composition work ( described C.P.E .

Bach’s Nachlass ‘the large Catholic Mass’ ) connected consecration Catholic Hofkirche Dresden , planned late 1740s postponed ( building started 1739 ) .

All known certain expansion 1733 Missa addition Credo , Sanctus ( 1724 ) movement ‘Osanna’ ‘Dona nobis pacem’ fusing various section create unified score ( see also §14 ) done last year Bach’s life – precisely , August 1748 October 1749 .

Instrumental music , however , came fore 1740s .

Bach begun sift older organ chorale 1739–42 , probably following completion Clavier-Übung III .

Some Weimar piece extensively reworked gathered new manuscript collection ( ‘18’ , bwv651–68 ) .

These revision may undertaken view subsequent appearance chorale print , happened six chorale movement cantata ( ‘Schübler Chorales’ ) 1748 .

Apparently Bach still engaged work chorale last month life .

The copying dictation chorale Vor deinen Thron bwv668 , later subject legend , fact probably confined improvement existing work ( chorale bwv641 Weimar Orgel-Büchlein ) .

Bach retained interest organ building last .

In 1746 alone two important examination inauguration organ : 7 August Zschortau 26–9 September Naumburg .

Bach’s appraisal large Hildebrandt organ Wenzelskirche , Naumburg , one important .

He customarily subjected instrument searching examination , technical reliability tone quality .

He also taken critical interest piano Gottfried Silbermann building 1730s , proposing alteration mechanism Silbermann evidently adopted .

At event , Bach praised Silbermann’s later piano promoted sale ( receipt one sold Poland , dated 6 May 1749 , survives ) .

On visit Potsdam 1747 played range Silbermann piano newer type purchased Prussian court .

The visit court Frederick Great May 1747 one notable biographical event Bach’s otherwise unspectacular life .

The invitation probably came Count Keyserlingk , Berlin .

Bach’s encounter Frederick began 7 May palace Potsdam chamber music feature every evening court life .

Bach’s execution piano remarkable improvisation theme supplied king met general applause .

The next day Bach gave organ recital Heiliggeistkirche Potsdam , chamber music evening improvised six-part fugue theme .

He also visited new Berlin opera house , possibly went look organ Potsdam Berlin .

On return Leipzig , probably middle May , worked industriously ‘elaboration King Prussia’s fugue theme’ , beginning writing fugue improvised ( three-part ricercare ) , , Potsdam , announced would print .

But decided larger project title Musikalisches Opfer ( ‘Musical Offering’ ) prepared work several movement dedicated Frederick Great ; work printed entirety end September ( Michaelmas ) 1747 .

The royal theme serf basis movement ( two ricercares , three six part , keyboard ; trio sonata flute , violin continuo ; various canon flute , violin continuo harpsichord obbligato ) .

In June 1747 , hesitation , Bach joined Correspondirende Societät der Musicalischen Wissenschaften founded Lorenz Mizler .

It probably 1747 submitted , ‘scientific’ piece work , canonic composition Vom Himmel hoch bwv769 .

At time sent member offprint six-part canon series bass Goldberg Variations .

He seems , however , taken interest society’s affair ( according C.P.E .

Bach ) thought nothing ‘dry , mathematical stuff’ Mizler wanted discus .

Besides long acquaintance pupil Mizler , Bach’s likely reason joining society prominent colleague Telemann Graun fellow member .

The beginning work Die Kunst der Fuge ( ‘The Art Fugue’ ) seem date around 1740 , .

It impossible give exact date original composing score lost .

However , must first version survives autograph fair copy containing 14 movement ( 12 fugue two canon ) dating 1742 latest .

Thereafter Bach expanded revised work readiness printing .

He supervised printing large extent , process probably largely complete end 1749 ( word , son Johann Christoph Friedrich , helped correct proof , left join court Bückeburg January 1750 ) .

But Bach see entire work ( eventually comprising 14 fugue four canon ) print ; son , probably C.P.E .

particular , took charge publication work appeared posthumously spring 1751 .

Bach unable complete fair copy last movement , quadruple fugue , fugal cycle end unfinished movement .

The editor decided mitigate effect adding organ chorale bwv668 , Vor deinen Thron tret ich hiermit , end ; revision last piece work occupy Bach .

In final year Bach suffered increasingly severe trouble eye , seriously restricting ability work leading eventually total blindness .

He probably composed nothing autumn 1749 .

The last known example handwriting , give impression increasing irregularity , clumsiness cramping , go October 1749 ( part score B minor Mass ) .

Other document put signature date late spring 1750 .

The cause eye disease seems lain untreated ( untreatable ) diabetes , may also caused neuropathy degenerative brain disease , evidence found dramatic change handwriting manuscript 1748–9 .

He gave performance St John Passion Good Friday 1749 without completing revision work begun 1740 .

His health must poor spring 1749 latest ; otherwise Leipzig town council would surely tactless submit J.G .

Harrer , protégé Dresden prime minister Count Brühl , examination post Kantor 8 June 1749 .

Out consideration Bach cantata performance concert hall rather one church .

The town chronicle reported authority expected Bach’s death .

When grandson Johann Sebastian Altnickol ( pupil Johann Christoph Altnickol married Elisabeth Juliane Friederica Bach ) baptized 6 October 1749 Naumburg Bach unable make short journey stand godfather person .

Bach’s state health ability work must fluctuated last year .

He appointed Johann Nathanael Bammler , former choir prefect Thomasschule provided two excellent reference 1749 , deputize occasion warranted .

But spite everything Bach entirely inactive .

In spring 1749 known corresponded Count Johann Adam vom Questenberg , apparently commission project .

Although detail known , reaffirms Bach’s obviously well-established connection major noble patron area Bohemia ( Count Sporck Lissa Kukus ) , Moravia ( Count Questenberg Jaroměřice ) Silesia ( Haugwitz family ) .

From May 1749 June 1750 engaged controversial correspondence Freiberg headmaster Biedermann .

In May 1749 Biedermann violently attacked cultivation music school ; Bach immediately felt called battle , among thing gave repeat performance satirical cantata controversy Phoebus Pan , No .

201 .

His involvement understandable , must seen parallel state affair Thomasschule , tendency fuelled Ernesti’s reform .

Bach solicited rejoinder part C.G .

Schröter , member Mizler’s society , even Mattheson joined , Hamburg .

Once , affair throw light situation German school early Enlightenment Bach’s last year Thomaskantor .

The integration academic musical tradition , institution century , process turning irreconcilable confrontation .

At end March Bach underwent eye operation , performed English eye specialist John Taylor ( later perform similar operation Handel ) .

It partly successful , however , repeated second week April .

The second operation ultimately unsuccessful , indeed Bach’s physique considerably weakened .

Yet late beginning May 1750 Johann Gottfried Müthel could go Leipzig , stay Bach’s house become last pupil .

To extent regular instruction possible circumstance remains uncertain .

In next two month Bach’s health deteriorated , 22 July , take last Communion home .

He died six day later , evening 28 July , stroke .

He buried two three day later cemetery Johanniskirche .

It known form funeral ceremony took music performed .

Bach’s wife , Anna Magdalena , addition domestic task loyal industrious collaborator , participating performance copying music , survived ten year .

She died abject poverty 1760 .

On death Bach left modest estate consisting security , cash , silver vessel , instrument – including eight harpsichord , two lute-harpsichords , ten string instrument ( among valuable Stainer violin ) , lute spinet – good , officially valued 1122 thaler 22 groschen ; divided widow nine surviving child marriage .

Bach evidently given instruction disposition musical Nachlass , ignored official valuation .

According Forkel , eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann ‘got it’ ( see §11 ) .

Iconography .

The oak coffin containing Bach’s remains exhumed 1894 : detailed anatomical investigation Professor Wilhelm His confirmed identity showed Bach medium build .

From skull impression Carl Seffner , 1898 , modelled bust , show undoubted similarity likeness Bach guaranteed authentic , Leipzig portraitist Elias Gottlob Haussmann .

That portrait exists two version , one dating 1746 ( Museum für Geschichte der Stadt Leipzig ; property Thomasschule ) one 1748 ( William H. Scheide Library , Princeton ; see , fig.4 ) .

The earlier , signed ‘E.G .

The obituary written immediately Bach’s death published 1754 contains following statement : ‘For long nought confute u mere possibility existence better organist keyboard player , reproached bold enough persist claim Bach prodigious organist keyboard player ever .

It may famous man accomplished much polyphony instrument reason expert – hand foot together – Bach ?

Whosoever pleasure hearing others , otherwise disposed prejudice , agree doubt unfounded .

And whosoever look Bach’s piece organ keyboard , , universally known , performed greatest perfection , likewise nothing say contradiction statement.’ The claim illustrates well-nigh legendary reputation Bach enjoyed lifetime .

His fame already spread beyond confines central Germany 1717 , challenged French virtuoso Louis Marchand competition court Dresden default Frenchman took flight .

‘It would wrong conclude defeat Marchand Dresden must poor musician .

Did great one Handel avoid every opportunity confronting late Bach … getting involved ? ’ ( Marpurg ) .

Keyboard music whole occupies crucial position Bach’s life many respect , even true work harpsichord organ .

No genre occupied Bach consistently intensively beginning career end .

His life professional musician began learning play keyboard , Ohrdruf 1695–1700 tuition elder brother Johann Christoph , study keyboard music best composer 17th century laid important foundation training composer .

The composition harpsichord , particular , provide opportunity ass Bach’s development stage creative life .

Bach bolder contemporary : first set limit keyboard skill , accepted restriction horizon – breadth foundation style comprehensive range genre composed .

The stylistic basis laid youth , undoubtedly important growing central German environment time gave opportunity learn different stylistic tendency side side , without bias towards one rather another .

As result model came highly diverse repertory .

The north German school , including master Buxtehude , Reincken , Bruhns , Lübeck Böhm , ranged alongside central German composer Pachelbel’s circle older pupil ( J.H .

Buttstedt , example , A.N .

Vetter ) Witt , Krieger , Kuhnau Zachow , well southern German colleague J.J. Froberger , J.C. Kerll J.C.F .

Fischer .

Italians Frescobaldi Battiferri confronted Frenchmen Lully , Marais , Grigny Raison .

Many name found large manuscript collection ( so-called Andreas-Bach-Buch Möllersche Handschrift ) copied Ohrdruf Bach , Johann Christoph .

They give clear picture repertory younger brother grew , showed – like young Handel , learning craft similar environment – ‘the manifold way writing composing various race , together single composer’s strength weaknesses’ .

No comparable sphere influence served challenge broadly based group musician exemplar later Bach’s life .

There , course , individual effect , Vivaldi 1710 , probably Couperin , exact contemporary Handel , group musician comparable range variety .

Bach’s dedication every keyboard genre form appears equally boundless .

The range remains constant throughout career , earliest last composition .

All major type represented : freely improvisatory ( prelude , toccata , fantasia ) , imitative strict ( fugue , fantasia , ricercar , canzona , capriccio , invention ) , combinatory ( multi-part prelude , prelude fugue ) multi-movement form ( sonata , suite partita , overture sinfonia , chaconne passacaglia , pastorale , concerto variation ) ; various type form chorale arrangement .

Unlike vocal music chamber Orchestral music , Bach’s keyboard output cover entire creative life .

There quite lengthy period heightened activity – organ music 1717 , harpsichord music date .

As whole , however , Bach seems cultivated two genre alongside .

It thus surprising , right beginning , consistently defiance inherited 17th-century tradition , abandoned conventional community repertory organ harpsichord , choosing write specifically one .

The uncompromising use obbligato pedal , particular , distinguishing mark Bach’s organ style .

Only exceptionally ( example chorale partita small chorale arrangement third part Clavier-Übung ) performing possibility coincide organ harpsichord become truly interchangeable .

Since Bach’s keyboard work pre-Leipzig year survive copy ( generally made circle Bach’s pupil ) rather autograph score , possible establish precise chronology .

Even relative one possible general term , consideration style authenticity holding balance .

In earliest work influence Bach’s model pronounced .

Pachelbel taught Johann Christoph Bach , master’s influence extended younger brother , visibly prevalently earliest extant composition .

Besides little organ chorale survive individually ( bwv749 , 750 756 ) , regarded Spitta Bach’s first musical essay , chorale Neumeister collection , came light recently ( bwv1090–1120 , bwv714 , 719 , 737 , 742 756 ) , taken among earliest work .

Although Neumeister manuscript represents neither integrated body work unified collection , dazzling variety embodies contradictory simultaneously essential trait Bach’s early organ music : imperfect technique alongside daring innovation ; reliance model Pachelbel , Johann Michael Johann Christoph Bach master north , south central Germany , together determination surpass dispense model ; entirely unorthodox mixture free composition strict polyphony , unconventional harmony pronounced virtuosity .

A subsequent stage Bach’s development found chorale partita bwv766–8 , mostly wrought manner Böhm ( bwv768 revised expanded Bach’s Weimar period ) .

The Canzona bwv588 , Allabreve bwv589 Pastorale bwv590 show south German Italian characteristic , Fantasia G bwv572 look French style .

With sectional layout , prelude E G minor , bwv566 535a , must written Buxtehude’s immediate influence .

The extraordinary harmonic boldness richness fermata embellishment piece bwv715 , 722 732 , intended accompany chorale , imply belong Arnstadt period Bach’s treatment chorale caused confusion among congregation .

The fugue Legrenzi Corelli , bwv574 579 , probably placed among early work .

Admittedly , scarcity autograph , combined complicated situation surrounding source , make difficult establish reliable chronology .

It scarcely possible even draw definite conclusion early keyboard work belong within period Bach’s youth , set 1700–07 .

The model recede importance Mühlhausen period , latest , Bach’s individuality begin pervade every note composition .

This applies particularly many extended organ chorale setting probably dating 1709 1712–13 already much accordance Bach’s later ideal found group 18 chorale ( bwv651–8 ) worthy revising 1740 .

In freely composed organ work ( toccata , prelude , fantasia fugue ) Bach tightened formal scheme , preparing way two-movement prelude fugue intermediate type fugue long , self-contained complex prelude yet unified section ( first movement bwv532 ) .

Here early manifestation one peculiarity Bach’s working method , encountered later ‘48’ : fugue attain final form almost instantaneously , prelude often go several stage development .

Probably important work year Passacaglia C minor bwv582 .

In 1713–14 decisive stylistic change came , stimulated Vivaldi’s concerto form .

Bach’s encounter Vivaldi’s music found immediate expression concerto Vivaldi’s opp.3 7 ( bwv593 etc . ) .

Features adapted Vivaldi include unifying use motivic work , motoric rhythmic character , modulation scheme principle solo–tutti contrast mean formal articulation ; influence may seen Toccatas F C bwv540 564 .

Apparently Bach experimented short free , concerto-like organ form three movement ( fast–slow–fast : cf bwv545 + 529/2 bwv541 + 528/3 ) finally turned two-movement form , bwv534 536 .

Of comparable importance introduction concerto element tendency towards condensed motivic work , Orgel-Büchlein .

Bach’s conception new type miniature organ chorale , combining rhetorical expressive musical language refined counterpoint , probably date back relatively early point , possibly beginning Weimar period , started collect systematically autograph 1713–14 .

Among earliest entered manuscript , among new composition , bwv608 , 627 630 , around 1715–16 Bach added bwv615 , 623 , 640 644 ( cite typical example ) .

Some piece , bwv601 639 , earlier date .

By end Weimar period Orgel-Büchlein complete essential , although isolated piece added later , bwv620 631 ( c1730 ) , fragment O Traurigkeit bwv613 ( c1740 ) .

The final total 45 piece fall considerably short 164 originally projected , Bach already ceased work consistently major undertaking early 1716 .

The reason unknown ; took Leipzig sporadically apparently connection teaching , copy made 1727–30 suggests .

Bach composed organ piece Cöthen , among undoubtedly C major Fantasia bwv573 added Anna Magdalena Bach’s Clavier-Büchlein ( 1722 ) .

In Leipzig , 1727 , composed trio sonata , new genre organ , wrote , according Forkel , eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann .

It probably conjunction renewed activity recitalist – known performed Dresden ( 1725 , 1731 1736 ) , Kassel ( 1732 ) , Altenburg ( 1739 ) Potsdam ( 1747 ) – returned prelude fugue genre .

Now , surely consequence ‘48’ , always wrote two section , prelude important fugue .

There final flourish virtuosity ( especially writing obbligato pedal ) work bwv544 548 ( c1730 ) , always context clearcut structure ( da capo fugue bwv548 ) .

In 1739 , third part Clavier-Übung , Bach published comprehensive varied group organ work .

Framed Prelude Fugue E flat ( bwv552 ) , nine chorale arrangement Mass 12 catechism , followed four duet .

Bach’s encyclopedic intention seen form work – collection specimen organ piece large church instrument smaller domestic one ( including harpsichord ) , symbolized invariable coupling large piece small ; equally seen variety contrapuntal method , whereby constantly produced fresh kind cantus firmus treatment .

At end Bach’s output organ disparate work C minor Fantasia Fugue bwv562 ( 1747–8 ) , ‘Schübler’ chorale ( arrangement solo movement cantata ) canonic variation Vom Himmel hoch bwv769 .

The variation , written Mizler’s society 1747 , survive two original version , printed autograph , whose different sequence movement show Bach experimenting symmetrical form placing climax .

None earliest dated precisely .

The Capriccio bwv992 assigned 1704 ; biographical data support ( extremely doubtful written Bach’s brother Johann Jakob ) , certainly belongs period immediately 1700 .

Before 1712–13 countless individual piece like toccata , prelude fugue ( last mainly using ‘repercussive’ thematic technique like early organ fugue ) ; variation form represented Aria variata bwv989 .

In toccata ( bwv910 etc . )

The first trace subsequent great work Leipzig period found 1725 Clavierbüchlein Anna Magdalena , fact anticipates so-called French Suites bwv812–17 Partitas bwv825–30 .

The Partitas particular ( appearing print singly 1726 ) represent culmination Bach’s keyboard output ; whereas ‘48’ show prelude fugue type developed consummate maturity , present similarly matured specimen popular harpsichord genre time , partita , comprising suite dance movement ‘galanteries’ .

These – burlesca , capriccio like – appear English French Suites ; English Suites , partita begin large-scale movement , differently titled different style .

Later , collected publication six 1731 , Bach inaugurated series published work general title Clavier-Übung ( title borrowed publication Kuhnau , predecessor office ) .

In 1735 appeared second part , whose content intended representative prominent fashionable style : Concerto Italian Style bwv971 embodies ultimate stage process transcribing instrumental concerto keyboard , stand contrast Overture French Manner bwv831 , markedly partita , represents specifically French harmony , rhythm , ornamentation melodic invention .

1741–2 eventually saw end Clavier-Übung series aria 30 variation known Goldberg Variations .

Apparently Bach cultivated variation form since youth , contrast Goldberg Variations early work ( chorale partita Aria variata ) marked .

This work outshines others far performing technique concerned ( Domenico Scarlatti’s influence unmistakable place ) .

The large-scale cyclical layout ( based sequence 10 x 3 movement , incorporating series nine canon , one every third variation , arranged order ascending interval move towards climax , final quodlibet ) without precedent .

The basis composition ground bass 32 bar , developed Ruggiero related bass pattern , first presented aria subjected free canonic elaboration wide variety way .

In monothematic emphatically contrapuntal conception , Goldberg Variations set scene Bach’s last keyboard work – Musical Offering Art Fugue .

The freshly composed piece probably date chiefly late 1730s ; work complete 1744 latest .

Apart one major undertaking , Bach appears composed keyboard work period : perhaps Fantasia ‘sur un rondeau’ bwv918 , certainly Fantasia C minor fragmentary fugue bwv906 .

The Prelude C minor bwv999 show affinity ‘48’ , may thus belong Cöthen early Leipzig period .

All lute work composed Leipzig , starting Fugue G minor bwv1000 , expanded polyphonic development violin fugue ( bwv1001 ) , ( like bwv997 ) tablature copied Bach’s friend , Leipzig lawyer lutenist Christian Weyrauch .

The Suite G minor bwv995 ( 1011 , cello ) date period 1727–31 dedicated Bach’s autograph unidentifiable ‘Monsieur Schouster’ .

It seems smaller part instrumental ensemble music ( least survives ) belongs Cöthen period , greater part composed Leipzig , principally collegium musicum Bach associated 1723 directed 1729 early 1740s .

Thus four Orchestral Suites , leaning towards French style , written Leipzig : No .

The intended instrumentation original always conclusively determined later version , allowance must also made substantial difference two version , extremely rarely case reconstruction supposed lost original really possible .

[ Top pageTop page ] Canons , ‘Musical Offering’ , ‘Art Fugue’ .

Bach’s preoccupation canon strictest form counterpoint traced back Weimar period .

In organ chorale particularly Orgel-Büchlein canonic principle play major role .

Canonic element present also several early vocal work .

Here however matter canonic technique cropping context complex contrapuntal construction ; genre right , canon , Bach’s day , would appear almost exclusively theoretical example composition teaching .

It sense often favoured – generally form circular canon – musician entry students’ album : entry normally notated enigmatic fashion , setting would-be solver intellectual exercise .

Bach wrote canon album ; part probably lost .

Except bwv1076–7 , surviving individual canon ( 1072–5 , 1078 , 1086 ) probably dedicatory work kind ; 1077 re-used purpose .

What probably earliest dated 2 August 1713 ( bwv1073 , dedicatee uncertain ) ; latest dated 1 March 1749 ( bwv1078 ; dedicatee Benjamin Faber ) .

A new kind theoretical canon came connection Goldberg Variations , canonic principle played special part .

In personal copy Goldberg Variations Bach wrote 1747–8 series 14 perpetual canon first eight bass note aria ground ( bwv1087 ) , exploring varied canonic possibility subject , subsequently arranging individual perpetual canon progressive order , organized according increasing contrapuntal complexity .

The type included range simple , double triple canon , retrograde canon stretto canon quadruple proportion canon augmentation diminution .

Nos.11 13 series identical bwv1077 1076 ( depicted Haussmann’s Bach portrait 1746 ) .

Closely related ( likewise probably dating later 1740s ) Vom Himmel hoch variation , Bach first used strictly canonic scheme monothematic work several movement progressive difficulty .

The Musical Offering ( 1747 ) also plainly influenced mode musical thinking .

Here , theme incomparably complex bwv1087 , devised ten canon differing structural type , notated puzzle canon original printed edition 1747 .

The series canon ‘royal theme’ includes canonic fugue , providing bridge canon , primarily theoretical conception though also intended performance , two keyboard fugue ricercares three six part .

A constituent part Musical Offering trio sonata flute , violin continuo , also based royal theme .

In second slow movement Bach introduced echo fashionable style practised Prussian court .

The Musical Offering , effect compendium three section , show Bach elaborating theme supplied Frederick Great every imaginable way ensemble three instrument .

The Art Fugue constitutes final contribution group monothematically conceived work intended representative example specific principle .

As didactic keyboard work , Art Fugue way form counterpart two book ‘48’ , difference exclusively fugue question , , , fugue developed single theme .

Bach’s work Art Fugue accomplished two stage – 1740 1745 , ( connection preparing work publication ) 1748–50 .

The extant autograph score represents conclusion first stage , conception work already appears clearly : beginning simple fugue ( Bach avoided term , speaking ‘contrapunctus’ ) , progressing ‘counter-fugues’ , double fugue triple fugue , interpolated canon , culminating mirror fugue .

For printed version number movement increased four ( two canon , fourth simple fugue notably closing quadruple fugue ) order rearranged expound logically ‘chapter instruction fugues’ .

When Bach died work may ‘complete’ form survived .

In particular quadruple fugue surely completed essential , since composition combinatorial section must necessarily early stage composition quadruple fugue .

Only three opening section exposition , however , extant , – abbreviated editor , give Art Fugue appearance mighty torso .

The Musical Offering Art Fugue mark end culmination Bach’s activity keyboard composer broadest sense .

While two ricercars ‘royal theme’ Musical Offering represent different fugal style ( forward- backward-looking ) different texture ( three- six-part polyphony ) , Art Fugue explores notably intensive monothematic conception .

As didactic keyboard composition sense counterbalance two part ‘48’ , yet difference concern fugue alone , series composition developed single ‘principal composition’ ( theme ) – using technique forward- backward-looking style operate alongside , synoptically .

It probably unintentional , yet hardly chance , initial premiss goal Bach’s keyboard art musical thinking come together Art Fugue .
